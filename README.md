# DonateAnyBook
## Team Name: Own Rules 
## Goals
1. Our website will serve as a helping hand for the unprivileged kids that grow up without proper education .
2. To introduce the culture of donating books to more and more people, we have introduced a rewarding system that will give coupon codes after every successful milestone of donating books.

## Working
1. The User will have to first signup on our website, this is an important step as all the donations by the user will be tracked and so the coupon code can be sent to the respective email.
2. The User will have to upload the photos of the Barcode of the Books that they want to donate. 
3. Apart from this, the user will have to enter the details for the pickup.
4. We will get all the information about the books by our Artificial Intelligence Model.
5. This will save a lot of userâ€™s time by not making them enter the details of every single book they want to donate.
6. As soon as we will have a donation of at least 20 books from a specific Pincode, our pickup partner will go to their respective houses and pick up the books and drop them to the respective partnered schools/College.
7. Users will receive coupon codes after every milestone of Donating books.
